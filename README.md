# Haptic-Based Virtual Activities for Hand Rehabilitation and Diagnosis in Stroke Patients

![Seminar & Research Only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Type%3A%20Seminar%20%26%20Research-blueviolet)

## Overview

Stroke is one of the most common causes of severe adult disability worldwide. This seminar explores how **Virtual Reality (VR)** and **haptic technologies** can assist in the **rehabilitation** and **diagnosis** of patients with hand impairments due to stroke.

The focus is on a conceptual framework that includes **five virtual, task-oriented exercises** based on established clinical assessments. These tasks aim to quantitatively evaluate hand functionality, track recovery, and support therapists in designing personalized rehabilitation plans.

## Objectives

This seminar was conducted to:
- Research the use of haptic and VR-based systems for stroke rehabilitation.
- Analyze existing frameworks that integrate virtual tasks with quantitative performance metrics.
- Understand how task-oriented virtual activities can assist occupational therapists in diagnosis and long-term recovery monitoring.
- Present key findings, potential applications, and future directions in a structured format.

## Virtual Activities Explored

The activities are inspired by the **Jebsen Test of Hand Function** and the **Box and Block Test**, including:

1. **Cup Movement** – Simulates picking up and placing a cup.
2. **Block Arrangement** – Tasks the user with organizing virtual blocks.
3. **Maze Navigation** – Guides hand movement through a virtual maze.
4. **Dumbbell Training** – Simulates lifting a virtual weight to assess strength and control.
5. **Rubber Ball Grasp** – Tests grip control through interaction with a virtual rubber ball.

## Key Concepts

- **Haptic Feedback**: Provides sensory stimulation to simulate touch, aiding motor control.
- **Quantitative Metrics**: Each activity is evaluated with metrics such as time, precision, and smoothness.
- **"Golden Metrics"**: Baseline data from healthy individuals used to benchmark patient performance.
- **Objective Assessment**: Enables therapists to make data-informed decisions about patient progress.
- **Decision Support System (DSS)**: A long-term goal of this research direction is to support remote, adaptive rehabilitation.

## Conclusion

This seminar emphasizes the potential of immersive, interactive systems in clinical rehabilitation. By combining established medical tests with virtual interaction and haptic feedback, a more engaging and quantifiable recovery process can be enabled. Although this is a conceptual exploration, it opens doors to future innovation in **tele-rehabilitation** and **data-driven therapy**.
